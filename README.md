**OptClick** is a minimal macOS app that allows you to simulate a right-click or a right-click hold by pressing the Option key.

It will be quite helpful in **gaming with a touchpad**, as it allows you to perform left and right clicks simultaneously.

## Installation

Requires **macOS 15.0 Sequoia** or above.

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/OptClick/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken". To resolve this, you need to go to *terminal* and run the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OptClick.app
```

You may be required to enter the password. When you are entering the password, the password is not shown. This is required by Apple. The app will **NOT** steal your password or personal information.
