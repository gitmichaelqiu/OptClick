**OptClick** is a minimal macOS app that allows you to simulate a right-click or a right-click hold by pressing the Option key.

It will be quite helpful in **gaming with a touchpad**, as it allows you to perform left and right clicks simultaneously.

## Usage

When OptClick is enabled, press `option` to simulate a right-click, hold `option` to perform a right-click hold (e.g. for aiming).

The default global hotkey for toggling OptClick is `control + R`.

You can modify it in Settings -> Shortcuts. Press `esc` while changing the hotkey to disable it.

## Installation

Requires **macOS 14.0 Sonoma** or above.

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/OptClick/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken". To resolve this, you need to go to *terminal* and run the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OptClick.app
```

You may be required to enter the password. When you are entering the password, the password is not shown. This is required by Apple. The app will **NOT** steal your password or personal information.
